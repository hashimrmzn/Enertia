    question: "What makes the Enertia Water Dispenser Unique?",
    answer:
      "The Enertia Water Dispenser offers four water options: hot, cold, room temperature, and carbonated. Our proprietary carbonation system uses a 0.6L user-replaceable CO₂ cylinder connected to a mixer tank located within the cooling tank. This design chills the CO₂ gas before mixing it with cold water, delivering refreshing sparkling water on demand. As you dispense carbonated water, the system automatically refills and repressurizes, ensuring a continuous supply.",
